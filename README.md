🌸 Iris Flower Classification using Random Forest:

This project demonstrates how to build a simple and effective machine learning model using the Random Forest Classifier on the well-known Iris dataset. The goal is to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica based on their features.

📌 Project Overview:

We use the Iris dataset from scikit-learn to:
- Load and explore the dataset.
- Convert it into a pandas DataFrame for easier handling.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train a Random Forest Classifier.
- Evaluate the model's performance on test data.

📊 Dataset Features:

The dataset contains 150 samples, with 4 features:

- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm)
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)

Target classes:

0 = Setosa
1 = Versicolor
2 = Virginica

🚀 Technologies Used:

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn (RandomForestClassifier, train_test_split)

🧪 Model Used:

Random Forest Classifier: A powerful ensemble learning method based on decision trees that improves accuracy and avoids overfitting.

📈 Accuracy:

Using RandomForestClassifier() with default parameters, the model typically achieves ~96% accuracy on the test set (may vary slightly).

✅ Learnings:

- How to load datasets from scikit-learn.
- Creating a DataFrame from a dataset.
- Splitting data using train_test_split.
- Training a classifier and evaluating its accuracy.
