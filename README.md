This project uses a Random Forest Classifier to classify iris flowers into one of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation on a classic dataset.

-> Features:

1. Data Preparation:
- Loads the Iris dataset and converts it into a pandas DataFrame for ease of manipulation.
- Prepares features (X) and target labels (y) for machine learning.
 
2. Random Forest Classifier:
- Trains a Random Forest model to classify iris flowers based on their petal and sepal measurements.
  
3. Model Evaluation:
- Evaluates the model's performance using accuracy on the test set.

-> Technologies Used: 

- Python: Programming language.
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model training and evaluation.

-> How It Works:

1. Data Loading:
- Loads the Iris dataset from scikit-learn and converts it into a pandas DataFrame.
  
2. Data Splitting:
- Splits the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
  
3. Model Training:
- Trains a Random Forest Classifier on the training set.
  
4. Model Evaluation:
- Evaluates the model on the test set and reports its accuracy.
